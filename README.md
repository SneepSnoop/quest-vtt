# Quest-VTT
**An implementation of the Quest roleplaying system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop**
***
## What is this?
Quest-VTT is an implementation of The Adventure Guild's [Quest roleplaying system](https://adventure.game/) for Foundry Virtual Tabletop! The Adventure Guild has published a [Creator's Resource (and license)](https://www.adventure.game/creators-license) that allows us to include the rules, character sheets, and _limited descriptions_ for things like classes, abilities, and items. The full content of the game is **not included**. Please support The Adventure Guild and consider [purchasing a copy of Quest](https://www.adventure.game/digital-edition) if you like what you see!

## Recommendations for Creating New Content
If you want to create new roles, ability paths, ability effects, or effect roll ranges, I highly recommend doing it in the following order:
1. Create your new role.
2. Create your new ability path
3. Create your new ability effect
4. Create your new effect(s)
5. Create your new effect roll ranges.

Once you have done all of this, move these items into the appropriate compendium. Once in the compendium build the connections, by dragging and dropping the appropriate association. E.g. Roles are associated with paths.

It is also possible to create connections from the default item list; however, I recommend utilizing the compendium method for easier filtering.

## FAQ
*   Why the complicated system for creating new content?
    **Answer**: I made the decision to allow for the creation of new content via non-coding means. By having the current, more complicated, system for creating content, it means that anyone can create new content.
*   Why are there no descriptions or effect roll ranges?
    **Answer**: Quest's creators' license allows for the basic descriptions provided. If you wish to expand upon what is available, I would highly recommend supporting The Adventure Guild, and purchasing a fully copy of Quest.
